# ManhattanDistrictHistory
[Manhattan District History documents](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan_district) published on Department of Energy OpenNet have been irreparably ruined by Adobe Acrobat's recognise text tool. I attempt to clean it up to make it a little bit more legible.

1. Dump pdf images by `pdftoppm -png -r 300`
2. ScanTailor Advanced
3. `convert *.tif out.pdf`
